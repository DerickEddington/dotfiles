# By default, don't create multiplexing, because this is more robust for my interactive sessions
# (because if the multiplexed connection has a problem, that interferes with (terminates or
# freezes) all sessions using it, which has happened to me both via accidents or via some bug in
# OpenSSH).  But do use a multiplexed connection to a host if such was already created by
# something else (which is assumed to be intentional for the use here).  Note that other apps
# (e.g. my Emacs configuration) can override this to create multiplexing, but those should use a
# different ControlPath namespace to be separate from my top namespace defined here and as such
# those will not cause my other sessions to use those.

# length of this pathname must be less than `sizeof(sockaddr_un.sun_path) - some_extra` (see `man
# 7 unix`) which is only `108 - 17` on Linux.  This is the primary reason to use the
# constant-length %C versus the other variable-length tokens, and is the reason to minimize the
# pathname length.)
