# This enables having per-host configuration when the home directory is shared across multiple
# hosts.  For each host you want specific configuration for, add a block like this with HOSTNAME
# substituted by the host's name:
#
# Match exec "uname -n | grep -q -E -e '^HOSTNAME$'"
#   Include ./config.d/per-host/HOSTNAME/*, ./config.d/per-host/HOSTNAME/*/*
#
# (Note: That `exec` command is both POSIX-portable and avoids OpenSSH's lack of support for
# escaping characters inside its quoted-argument syntax.  Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a
# better way since the `Include` directive lacks support for expanding environment variables
# (unlike some of the other directives).)

Match exec "uname -n | grep -q -E -e '^yoyo$'"
  Include ./config.d/per-host/yoyo/* ./config.d/per-host/yoyo/*/*
