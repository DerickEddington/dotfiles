The ./platform/$(uname)/bin/ directories can be used for both generating wrapper functions and/or
for adding to the PATH.  Wrapper functions are safer because their scope is only that of a shell
process (and its sub-shells).  Adding to the PATH can be useful but is risky because it can affect
a host's other programs that assume that utilities named the same are the non-GNU default/stock
variants of that platform and this can alter/break how such programs behave.
