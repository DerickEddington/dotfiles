# Create a temp dir, with a name determined by my GDB variable, that is
# exclusive to this instance of gdb, to avoid race conditions with the
# possibility of other instances.
#
# The primary use case for this is to support the technique of dynamically
# `source`ing a .gdb file that was generated by some user-defined GDB command to
# contain assignments of variables to values that capture the results of shell
# commands.  E.g.:
#   eval "shell echo \"set \\$fromOutside = $(/bin/foo --bar)\" \
#                 > /tmp/my-gdb-%u/foo.gdb", $myGDBtmpDirID
#   eval "source /tmp/my-gdb-%u/foo.gdb", $myGDBtmpDirID
#   eval "shell rm /tmp/my-gdb-%u/foo.gdb", $myGDBtmpDirID
#   print $fromOutside
#
