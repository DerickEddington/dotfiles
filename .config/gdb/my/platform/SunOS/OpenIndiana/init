# Setting this last seems to help avoid the dreaded GDB bug on Solaris of:
# "procfs: couldn't find pid 0 in procinfo list."
target exec

# For some reason, spurious SIGTRAP signals are sometimes received.  This signal seems to be
# unneeded for breakpoints on x86_64 (presumably because GDB uses hardware breakpoints instead.)
# You may try uncommenting this:
#handle SIGTRAP nostop noprint nopass
