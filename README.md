# My User Home Directory Configuration

As used for my personal laptop.

## Noteworthy Aspects

- Incorporates [Home Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager),
  with substantial configuration for MATE Desktop and Firefox.

- Substantial Emacs configuration, and a little configuration for other apps.
  (Not managed by Home Manager.)

- Custom Bash prompt.

- Enables both: sharing changes between multiple users (via the `main` branch),
  and tracking private per-user dot-files (in private per-user branches).
